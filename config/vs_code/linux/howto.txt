the 'tasks.json' file is the build file for live input in c++ in vscode for linux
currently it doesn't work for c...

in vscode, goto terminal -> build -> new build -> other

paste the code of 'tasks.json' in the file and save.

hit ctrl+b to run!

(input.txt and output.txt must be present in your current working directory...)

this also produces a sys.txt in the same folder, that contains the details of the program after execution like the memory and time utilized by the program!
